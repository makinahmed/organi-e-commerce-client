    "description": "As mentioned, these are a little more involved. They require some tending to butter, some chill times, some extra willpower to not eat ALL the dough before baking. But beyond that, truly not too overly complicated Brown the butter. Cut the butter into small pieces for even melting. Swirl in a pan over medium heat. It will get bubbly and then foamy â€“ once the butter starts to turn golden brown (happens quickly!), remove from heat and transfer to a bowl to cool for a bit Make the dough. Youâ€™ll get the cooled brown butter (make sure to scrape in all those golden brown bits!) and sugars going first. Then eggs and dry ingredients to that. Hold off on those chocolate chips Let the dough rest! It will need to cool for a bit before you add the chocolate chips so they donâ€™t melt. Once itâ€™s fully cooled, add your choco chips and let the dough rest again to fully hydrate the flour and let htat browned butter work its flavor magic Scoop and bake! You know the drill.They are grown-up and almost-fancy. There is more effort required. And the reward is that there is more nuance to both the flavor and the texture. Making them is not overly complicated but itâ€™s also not mindless. These are the cookies for when you need to impress, even if the only person youâ€™re impressing is yourself on a Wednesday night. I feel this is a good time to let you know that this particular cookie dough tastes amazing. AMAZING. Next level. Itâ€™s where the browned butter flavor comes through the most. Iâ€™m not recommending eating raw cookie dough, Iâ€™m just saying, alright? The originals will still be there for you when you need them. Today is a day to go brown some butter and then experience the rush of sinking your teeth into that crispity edge with the underbaked, slightly thick, gooey, rich center. Treat. Your. Self."

These are the cookies for when you need to impress, even if the only person youâ€™re impressing is yourself on a Wednesday night. I feel this is a good time to let you know that this particular cookie dough tastes amazing. AMAZING. Next level. Itâ€™s where the browned butter flavor comes through the most. Iâ€™m not recommending eating raw cookie dough, Iâ€™m just saying, alright? The originals will still be there for you when you need them. Today is a day to go brown some butter and then experience the rush of sinking your teeth into that crispity edge with the underbaked, slightly thick, gooey, rich center. Treat. Your. Self."

Hold off on those chocolate chips Let the dough rest! It will need to cool for a bit before you add the chocolate chips so they donâ€™t melt. Once itâ€™s fully cooled, add your choco chips and let the dough rest again to fully hydrate the flour and let htat browned butter work its flavor magic Scoop and bake! You know the drill. Edges cooked, middle a little soft and puffy(Okay, let rest one more time ðŸ˜¬). Donâ€™t be mad. But it lets those middles sink and get super dense and barely thick and everything is perfectly chewy-crisp. What a dream.Browned butter chocolate chip cookies (these ones youâ€™re looking at now): These cookies are a work of art. They have complex, rich flavor. They have more of that crispy-meets-soft-and-yummy texture. They are grown-up and almost-fancy. There is more effort required.
